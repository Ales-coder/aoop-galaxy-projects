Assignment 1 – Galaxy Domain Model

Core logic of the galaxy:
	•	Generic distance calculation (MathUtil)
	•	StarCollection with distance rules
	•	Automatic double star detection
	•	Lazy planet generation (on demand)
	•	PlanetCollection behaving like Map<Star, List<Body>>
	•	CSV-based loading
	•	Console statistics (Assignment 1c)

Dataset included: teststars.csv
Large datasets excluded to keep repository lightweight.
